### About the Project
Pixel Runner is a simple 2D game built using Python3 and Pygame. It was built to understand the basics of the Pygame library and the foundations of 2D game mechanics. It also provided an excellent opportunity to futher explore object-oriented programming concepts, and the use of Python classes. Enjoy!
